      <h1>Services We Offer</h1>
        <p style="white-space:pre-wrap ;">All projects begin with an initial design consultation. This 1 to 2 hour meeting discusses your design vision, your project goals and the general budget you have in mind. We then talk about the best possible approach and the services required for your project’s specific needs.</p>

        <br><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Royal Consultants Architects Engineers encourages a holistic approach to the design and construction process; offering full architectural and architectural interior services. With this approach, Royal Consultants is integral from the initial conceptual design. Working to foster dialogue and coordination with the builder and all the design consultants, Roya; consultants strives to produce a highly coordinated and detailed set of construction drawings and specifications. RA+D will continue to provide support through project pricing and the entire construction of your project until the day you move in.</p>

        <br><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Focused on being a custom architecture + design studio, services also have the ability to be customized. Royal Consultants Architects Engineers recognizes that full architectural services are sometimes beyond your project’s needs and therefore tailored a la carte services are available.

            <h3>ARCHITECTURE DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
            <p>Creating projects that are a true reflection of the client's personality and style requires really getting to know them on a personal level. Custom design is truly that "custom." Pre-design is a continuation of the initial design meeting. This is the time to get to know the client even better, the site and the overall project requirements and regulations. Open dialogue with the client aids in developing a complete program outline for the project. </p>

        <div class="services-col">
            <h3>CONCEPTUAL + SCHEMATIC DESIGN</h3>
            <p>Conceptual design flows into schematic design seamlessly. Diagrams become rooms and overall forms begin to take shape and building elevations are developed. This phase typically encompasses 2 to 4 client meetings depending on the project’s complexity. A client’s interaction and feedback continues to be instrumental in developing the architectural design. Once the client is pleased with the plans and the overall base building elevations and forms. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="services-col">
          <h3>DESIGN DEVELOPMENT</h3>
          <p>As the design progresses, the building is refined and evolves into the foundation for precise working drawings. The client continues to be integral to the process by reviewing the design and making decisions. The conversation now is focused on exterior finish materials and the overall project’s finer details.The point in the project that a builder becomes involved can vary from project to project.</p>

      <p>Architectural Interior Design Services follows the same process from conceptual design through construction as Architectural Services does. In regards to the timeline of the interior design process, conceptual and schematic design lags behind the building architectural progress by a design phase. Once the building architecture is in design development, spaces are starting to be defined 3-dimensionally and it is then that the interior architecture can begin to be studied in greater detail.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Conceptual and schematic vignettes develop into design development and into material selection. Drawings and details evolve along with specifications to produce the construction documents.</p>  
      <br>
      <p>Royal Consultants provides services for designing, drawing plans, drawing elevations, detailing, specifying and coordinating fixed interior finishes and elements within the project.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The scope within these documents may include:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Interior Architectural Design</li>
        <br><li>Kitchen + Bath Design & Renovation</li>
        <br><li>Interior Open Concept Renovations</li>      
        <br><li>Cabinetry & Custom Built-Ins Design</li>      
        <br><li>Closet Layout & Design</li>
        <br><li>Flooring Selection</li>
        <br><li>Plumbing Fixture Selection & Coordination</li> 
        <br><li>Appliance Selection & Coordination</li>
        <br><li>Decorative Lighting Selection</li>                                    
      </ul>
      
      <br>
      <p>Architectural Interiors covers the scope of the fixed interior finishes and design. Royal Consultants works closely with Interior Decorators to coordinate all loose finishes and accessories. A client may also choose to hire an Interior Designer. In this scenario, RA+D’s services can be modified to compliment and support the Designer’s scope to ensure a complete set of documents for the builder.</p>
