        <h1>Services We Offer</h1>
          <p style="white-space:pre-wrap ;">All projects begin with an initial design consultation.

With this approach, Royal Consultants is integral from the initial conceptual design. Working to foster dialogue and coordination with the builder and all the design consultants, Roya; consultants strives to produce a highly coordinated and detailed set of construction drawings and specifications. Royal consultants will continue to provide support through project pricing and the entire construction of your project until the day you move in.</p>

              <h3>ARCHITECTURE DESIGN PROCESS</h3>
              <p>Creating projects that are a true reflection of the client's personality and style requires really getting to know them on a personal level. Custom design is truly that "custom." Pre-design is a continuation of the initial design meeting. This is the time to get to know the client even better, the site and the overall project requirements and regulations. Open dialogue with the client aids in developing a complete program outline for the project. </p>

          <div class="services-col">
              <h3>CONCEPTUAL + SCHEMATIC DESIGN</h3>
              <p>Conceptual design flows into schematic design seamlessly. Diagrams become rooms and overall forms begin to take shape and building elevations are developed. This phase typically encompasses 2 to 4 client meetings depending on the project’s complexity. A client’s interaction and feedback continues to be instrumental in developing the architectural design. Once the client is pleased with the plans and the overall base building elevations and forms. </p>

            <h3>DESIGN DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>As the design progresses, the building is refined and evolves into the foundation for precise working drawings. The client continues to be integral to the process by reviewing the design and making decisions. The conversation now is focused on exterior finish materials and the overall project’s finer details.The point in the project that a builder becomes involved can vary from project to project.</p>
